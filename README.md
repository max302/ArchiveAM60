# Introduction

The [AM60](http://www.archivemotorcycle.fr/gamme-cafe-racer/cafe-racer-am60-125-black-mat/) (and the scrambler variant [AM-64](http://www.archivemotorcycle.fr/gamme-scrambler/scrambler-am64-125-black-mat/)) is an air-cooled 125cc motorcycle sold and distributed in Europe by Archive Motorcycle ([FR](http://www.archivemotorcycle.fr/), [IT](http://www.archivemotorcycle.it/)).

It is a Chinese-made, parts-bin bike based off a fuel-injected Honda 125CC power-plant (CBF125), dressed up as a stylish cafe racer. Because of it is based off a cloned power plant and built from foreign-made generic parts, parts listings and inter-compatibility with genuine Honda parts are not readily compiled. This repo aims to better document this motorcycle and it's variants based off end-user experience.

## Contributing

Any first hand experience with these motorcycles is greatly appreciated, although technical information (parts compatibility, schematics, maintenance procedures) is perferred, as the aim is to replaced a non-existent shop manual with user-provided info.

For any motorcycle enthusiasts not familiar with git that still want to contribute, please consult [the github guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) or reach out to me directly.
